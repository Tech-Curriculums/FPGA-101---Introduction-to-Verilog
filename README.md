FPGA 101 - Introduction to Verilog


In this course we will use the Spartan 3E and associated text to discuss Verilog FPGA programming.


## Beyond PCBs

PCBS allowed you to use other people's logical chips and functions, but suppose you wanted to make your own chip and *make it fast*? 

Atmel chips have a lot of overhead and limited functionality -- but with FPGAs you can start to prototype your own chip.


## Efficiency, Speed, Parallelism

FPGA programming is not like normal programming -- parallelism is easy, but because things are more bare metal, you will need to have the hardware in mind while creating your code.

## FPGAs as Pre-ASIC

FPGAs are not the fastest you can get.  Traditionally, you start with FGPAs then transition to ASICs for faster speeds and smaller sizes (less overhead).  But FPGAs are the middle step -- with costs/consequences much lower than ASICs, most companies (or so when I was a graduate student) use this as their proving grounds.

Are you ready to take the next step in Hardware Path?
